# It's me
Hi, I am Eolien55

I am in 10th grade, so it is very likely that I will answer several hours after

I love maths and algorithms, but I don't know much because I am just a 10th-grader, so I'd love if you could teach me a few things

I started programming 3 years ago, and since, I've developped a few skills :
- Backend development (python, rust, and node js)
- Desktop applications development (rust, python, c++ and java)
- Automation (bash scripting and python)
- A very primitive front-end development (HTML, basic CSS and primitive front-end JS)

And that's it ! If you think I can help you in any manner, you better contact me via discord. Here's my id : Eolien55#7078
