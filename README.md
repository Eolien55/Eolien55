# I'm happy
Hi, I am Eolien55
I am in 10th grade, so it is very likely that I will answer several hours after

I love maths and algorithms, but I don't know very much because I am just a 10th-grader, so I'd love if you could teach me a few things

I started programming 3 years ago, and since, I've developped a few skills :
- Backend development (python, for now)
- Desktop applications development (python, c++ and java)
- Automation (bash scripting and python)
- A very primitive front-end development (HTML, basic CSS and primitive JS)

And that's it ! If you think I can help you in any manner, you better contact me via discord. Here's my id : Eolien55#7078

I don't have much experience in open source projects, so I would be very glad if you think that I would be helpful.
